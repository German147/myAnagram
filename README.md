## General info
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase,
typically using all the original letters exactly once.[1] For example, the word anagram itself can be
rearranged into nag a ram, also the word binary into brainy and the word adobe into abode.
Here I work with arrays to find out wheather Strings are Anagram or not.
