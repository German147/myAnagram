/*An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word
or phrase. Here I create two objects, x and y,  I will perform two steps to see if
the words are anagram or not.
First Step: I have to Sort the data in string
Second Step: I have to compare the sorted data.
Finally if the sorted data are equal they are anagram, but if they are not, well, they are not anagram*/
